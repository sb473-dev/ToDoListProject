CS 3354 – ToDo List Project Design Document

1. Project Description
This project implements a simple ToDo List application using Java, Swing, and Gradle. 
Users can create tasks, update them, mark them as completed, delete them, and view task lists. 
The application saves and loads task data using a text file ("tasks.txt").

The project follows requirements from the CS 3354 project list:
- GUI built with Swing
- Data stored in a text file
- Uses Java Collections (ArrayList)
- Structured as a Gradle project

2. CRC Cards

--- Task ---
Responsibilities:
- Store task ID, description, and completion status
- Provide accessors/mutators
Collaborators:
- TaskManager

--- TaskManager ---

- Manage all Task objects
- Add, update, delete, complete tasks
- Load/save tasks to file
Collaborators:

3. UML Diagrams (Text Version)

Task
------------------------
- id: int
- description: String
- completed: boolean
+ getId()
+ getDescription()
+ isCompleted()
+ setDescription()
+ setCompleted()

TaskManager
------------------------
- tasks: List<Task>
- nextId: int
- FILE_NAME: String
+ addTask()
+ updateTask()
+ markCompleted()
+ deleteTask()
+ getAllTasks()
+ getCompletedTasks()
+ saveToFile()
+ loadFromFile()

ToDoGUI
------------------------
- manager: TaskManager
- displayArea: JTextArea
- inputField: JTextField
- idField: JTextField
+ refresh()
+ main()

Relationships:
ToDoGUI → uses → TaskManager  
TaskManager → contains many → Task  

4. Business Rules
- Every task has a unique integer ID
- Task descriptions must be non-empty
- Completed tasks remain in the list
- Data is saved after every modification
